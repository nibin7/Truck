# Tire Sensor Data Analysis
This repository contains data on tire locations, including temperature, pressure, GPS latitude, GPS longitude, vehicle speed, fuel level, oil pressure, and engine temperature. The data is stored in a CSV file named 16wheeltrucksample.csv.


# Requirements

To run the code in this repository, you will need the following software:

 * Python 3
* pandas 
 * matplotlib

# Code

The file Truck Data Analysis.ipynb contains the Python code for analyzing and visualizing the tire data. The code reads in the data from 16wheeltrucksample.csv using pandas, and then performs various analysis and visualization tasks, including:

  * Summary statistics of the data
  * Scatter plot of temperature and pressure for all tires
  * Scatter plot of temperature and pressure for all tires with tire locations labeled
  * Calculation of the correlation coefficient between temperature and pressure
  * Histogram of pressure for all tires

# Results

The code in Truck Data Analysis.ipynb produces various visualizations and summary statistics of the tire data. These results can be used to identify trends or anomalies in the data, and can inform decisions about tire maintenance or replacement.
